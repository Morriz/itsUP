# Testing TODO - Functional Tests Expansion

**Status:** ‚úÖ All Priority Items COMPLETE + 90%+ Core Coverage Achieved!
**Goal:** Expand functional test coverage with real tools, remove redundant mocked unit tests, achieve 90%+ coverage on core modules

**Summary:** Successfully added 40 functional tests across 5 test modules, removed 4 redundant mocked unit tests, verified command tests are minimal. Achieved 90%+ coverage on all critical core modules. Overall coverage increased from 17% to 63%. All 130 tests passing (90 unit + 40 functional).

**Status:** ‚úÖ Done

**Completed:**

  - Removed `test_decrypt_to_memory_success` (replaced by roundtrip)
  - Removed `test_load_encrypted_env_success` (replaced by functional)

- [x] `test_generated_traefik_config_is_valid` - Validates Traefik YAML structure and merging
- [x] `test_dns_honeypot_consistency` - Verifies DNS_HONEYPOT constant consistency across all generated files

## üìù Testing Guidelines (For Future Reference)

### When to Write Unit Tests
- Pure logic (calculations, data transformations)
- Helper functions (no I/O)
- Error handling (invalid input)
- Fast (<1ms per test)

### When to Write Functional Tests
- External tool integration (sops, git, docker)
- File system operations
- Configuration validation
- Command end-to-end testing
- Acceptable speed (<100ms per test)

### Red Flags (Indicates Need for Functional Test)
- `@patch("subprocess.run")`
- `@patch("Path.exists")`
- Complex mock setups (>5 lines)
- Testing `cwd` parameter or implementation details
